My web portfolio was rather straight forward to create. I tried using SASS for an extra bit of challenge as its not something we have used a whole lot of in the class. The two biggest challenges I faced were the dropdown menu, and the Modal image gallery. The dropdown menu I had created incorrectly the first time and id didnâ€™t work properly. This was a simple fix. The Modal Image gallery was not so simple. It took allot of research as Java Script is not something we have learnt or tried yet. Overall a great learning experience. 
All of the images, icons, and logos are my own.
